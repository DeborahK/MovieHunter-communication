# MovieHunter-communication
Code for my talks on Angular component communication. (For <i>Angular version 5 or higher</i>)

`MH-1`: Files for demonstrating communication between a template and its component, specifically tracking user-entered changes so the component can perform an operation, such as filtering, and setting focus to an element using the ViewChild decorator.

`MH-2`: Files for demonstrating communication between a child component and parent component using input and output properties.

`MH-3`: Files for demonstrating communication between components using a service as an intermediary. Demonstrates use of Subject and BehaviorSubject. 

`MH-4`: Files for demonstrating communication between components using a service as an intermediary. Demonstrates use of getters instead of Subject and BehaviorSubject for communicating changes. 

`MH-5`: Files for demonstrating a more complex UI with both detail and edit appearing on the right via routing. Demonstrates use of getters instead of Subject and BehaviorSubject for communicating changes.

`MH-6`: Files for demonstrating a simple NgRx implementation (starting from MH-3).

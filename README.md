# MovieHunter-communication
Code for my talks on Angular component communication. (For <i>Angular version 5 or higher</i>)

`MH-Take1`: Starter files for demonstrating communication between a template and its component, specifically tracking user-entered changes so the component can perform an operation, such as filtering, and setting focus to an element using the ViewChild decorator.

`MH-Take2`: Starter files for demonstrating communication between a child component and parent component using input and output properties.

`MH-Final`: Final files for demonstrating component communication.
